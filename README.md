# CoachPlanner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, create a new file in the `src/components/` directory. You can structure and name your components as you like.

Example:

Create a folder `MyComponent` inside `src/components` and add `MyComponent.jsx` and `MyComponent.css`.

If you're using TypeScript, use `.tsx` instead of `.jsx`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io). It will watch for file changes and re-run the relevant tests.
